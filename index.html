    <h1>Education</h1>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        <h3>Master's degree (2018-2020)</h3>
        <p>I have completed my master's of Theoretical Computer Science at Jagiellonian University in Kraków.</p>
        <p>In my master's thesis I implemented algorithms for recognizing and coloring perfect graphs. I implemented a
          theoretical paper creating a first usable polynomial time program for recognizing perfect graphs. I also parallelized its most time-consuming parts using GPU, greatly improving its performance. In addition I
          explored practicality of the ellipsoid method for coloring perfect graphs. </p>

          <h3>Perfect Graph Recognition and Coloring</h3>
          <p>Perfect graphs are a subject of intense study since their introduction in 1961.
            Only in 2001 the famous perfect graph conjecture was proven to be true and in
            2005 a polynomial method of determining if a graph is perfect was found. Since
            1988 an algorithm is known for coloring perfect graphs, but it uses an ellipsoid
            method which is said to be complicated and impractical. As recently as in 2018
            a polynomial algorithm that uses a combinatorial approach for coloring perfect
            graphs without squares was published.</p>
          <p>We begin with basic definitions in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we introduce
            perfect graphs and Berge graphs, give an overview of the strong perfect graph
            theorem and talk about an algorithm for polynomial perfect graph recognition.
            Chapter 3 is a study of the ellipsoid method of coloring perfect graphs. In
            Chapter 4 we present our implementation of algorithms from Chapters 2 and 3,
            along with notes on optimization and parallelisation. Appendix A is a overview
            of the recent algorithm for coloring square-free perfect graphs.</p>

        <h3>Bachelor's degree (2015-2018)</h3>
        <p>In my bachelor's thesis I implemented a parallel CUDA algorithm for calculating Lowest Common Ancestors (LCA)
          of a tree.</p>

        <div class="collapsibleContent">
          <h3>Solving LCA Problem on GPU</h3>
          <h4>Practical Algorithm with Theoretical Guarantees</h4>
          <p>The common knowledge is that classic PRAM graph algorithms do not fit well the GPU architecture. We show
            that it is not necessarily the case and investigate an Euler tour based algorithm for parallel LCA
            calculation on a modern GPU. Our experiments prove that the theoretically optimal PRAM algorithm is on par
            with a simple naïve solution on average, and outperforms it considerably in the worst-case scenarios.</p>

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>
        <h2>Microsoft Internships</h2>
        <p>I was thrice interning at Security Services team of Cloud+AI Group at Microsoft. The team I was a part of
          created and maintained services dealing with high business impact cryptographic secrets.</p>
        <p>All my internships at Microsoft were with the same team, which allowed us to pursue ambitious projects.
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li>
            <h3>Summer 2019</h3>
            <p>I created a tool for for diagnosing an insecure or faulty state of a system that is utilizing
              Virtualization Based Security (VBS) technologies. </p>
            <p>This project was almost entirely self-driven and during my 3 months of the internship I had a chance to
              understand the problem, design a solution and go through a few cycles of internal shipping and subsequent
              improvements. I also had a chance to understand intricacies and interplays of many parts of the VBS such
              as the Hypervisor, HVCI, TPM and UEFI secure boot.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Summer 2018</h3>
            <p>I created a proof-of-concept work for moving one of our team's services from on-premises servers to Azure.
            </p>
            <p>The main difficulty of the project laid in the service's heavy utilization of Hardware Security Modules
              (HSM) that was partly incompatible with Azure API's. I worked with Microsoft's cryptographic team to find
              a solution that would be usable on Azure. In the end, I created a fully working prototype that utilized
              Azure HSMs. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Summer 2017</h3>
            <p>I created an alternative logging solution for one of our team's service.</p>
            <p>The project required me to understand workings of the service, of the logging solution already utilized and
              of the new logging solution. I created a working alternative solution ready to be used by the Data
              Intelligence team. This internship helped me understand how our services were built and allowed me to
              receive more ambitious projects in later internships. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sabre Internship</h3>
        <p>I was an intern at Sabre Kraków during four months of summer 2016. I quickly completed the main task of the
          internship (adding a feature to a logging solution) and had a chance to complete regular programming tasks for the rest of
          the internship. </p>
